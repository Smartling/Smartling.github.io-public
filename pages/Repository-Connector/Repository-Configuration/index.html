title:  Repository Connector - Setup your Code Repository
---

  <p>
    To configure your code repository to work with the Repository Connector you will need to create a translation configuration file in your repository.
</p>
<p>
    This step must be completed before you will be able to push files from your repository to Smartling and to push translations back to your repository.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Create translation configuration file</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Create a JSON file and push it somewhere in your repository. Default filename is smartling-config.json. This file defines resource file that should be
    uploaded and how to save translated files that are downloaded from Smartling. The file must be valid JSON.
</p>
<p>
    You can use this annotated example file as a basis for your smartling-config.json file.

    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Parameters:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>locales</strong>
        - Locales has two functions. If automatically authorizing content that is uploaded to Smartling (default behavior), it determines which locales content
will be authorized for. It also serves as a mapping of locale codes from the Smartling API codes to the codes that should be used in the repository.        <strong>Smartling locale code must be unique per configuration file. The file must list at least one locale. </strong>Note that if you add extra
        languages to your project, you will need to update this file for the new languages to be handled by the Repository Connector.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>smartling</strong>
- Smartling locale code. Codes for locales in your project can be copied from <strong>Project Settings&gt;API</strong> in the            <a href="https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api.htm" rel="nofollow">dashboard</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>application</strong>
            - locale code that will be used when pushing translated files back to the repository. This can be any format
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>resourceSets</strong>
        - defines an array of resource sets. Each set identifies a group of repository files that will be uploaded to Smartling with the same settings.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>pathRegex</strong>
            - Java 7 Regular expression defining which repository files to upload to Smartling. All files matching the expression will be uploaded.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>type</strong>
- The Smartling API “fileType”. Possible values: "javaProperties", "ios", "android", "gettext", and so on. See Smartling’s            <a href="/pages/supported-file-types/" rel="nofollow">Supported File Types</a> documentation for the full list.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>authorizeContent </strong>
            (optional) - defines whether uploaded content will automatically be authorized for translation. Possible values: ‘true’ (default), ‘false’.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>translationPathExpression</strong>
            (optional) - Java 7 regular expression used to create a file path and name for translated files. If this value is not defined, translated files in
            the Smartling dashboard will not be pushed to the repository. Predefined variables for the expression are:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>locale</strong>
                - project locale code value (as defined at locales.application)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>originalFile</strong>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>fullName</strong>
                    - full path and name of original file
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>path</strong>
                    - original file path only
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>name</strong>
                    - original file name with extension
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>baseName</strong>
                    - original file name without extension
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>extension</strong>
                    - original file extension
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Groups defined in your pathRegex expression can also be used as variables.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <strong>translationCommitMessage</strong>
            (optional) - Java 7 regular expression defining a translation commit message. If not defined, a default value "Translation $originalFile.fullName
to $locale" will be used. Predefined variables are the same as those for <strong>translationPathExpression</strong>, plus            <strong>translatedFile,</strong> which contains the translated file path and name, with the same attributes as the <strong>originalFile</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>smartlingDirectives</strong>
            - array of strings which have the format &lt;directive name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;. File directives can be used to alter the way Smartling handles your
            files. See our <a href="/pages/supported-file-types/" rel="nofollow">Supported File Types</a> documentation for
            information on which directives are available for each file type.
