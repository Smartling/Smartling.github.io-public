<h4>
    What happens if I add locales to my project?
</h4>
<p>
    If you add locales to your project you will need to update your translation configuration file and add the new locales to the array. When the configuration file is uploaded, the Repository Connector will automatically update files in the Smartling dashboard based on your new settings.

    <h4>
    Why are my translated files being re-uploaded to the Dashboard as original files?
</h4>
<p>
    The Repository Connector cannot automatically distinguish between an original file and a translated file in the repository. The Connector uploads files based on the value of <code>resourceSets.pathRegex</code> in your translation configuration file. If your regular expression makes use of wildcards or your translated files are downloaded to the same folder as your original files, it may be that both original and translated files will match the regular expression. To avoid this problem, alter the structure of your repository or tighten your regular expression.

Can I alter the configuration files while the Repository Connector is running?
</h4>
<p>
   You can alter the translation configuration file while the connector is running. If it is hosted in your code repository, any new commit to this file will trigger an automatic update to the Smartling dashboard. However, changes to the <code>repo-connector.conf</code> file require a restart to come into effect.d
