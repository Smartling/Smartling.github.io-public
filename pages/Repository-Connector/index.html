title:  Repository Connector
---

<p>
    When working with localized content in an agile, continuous deployment environment, it is critical to optimize for translation speed. The Repository
    Connector is designed to shorten the time it takes to translate new content by automatically pushing changes to resource files in a repository to the
    Smartling dashboard and pushing new translations back to the repository.
</p>
<p>
    The Repository Connector acts a broker between the source repository and the Smartling project. Changes to resource files in the repository are
    automatically pushed to the Smartling project. The Connector will register a callback for each file so that it can be notified when the file is completely
    translated, then it will immediately download the translated file and can optionally push the translated files back to the repository.
</p>
<p>
    The Repository Connector is a java application that must run continuously on a publicly addressable server.

Translation progress can be monitored in the Smartling Dashboard or scripted with    <a href="https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Files+API" rel="nofollow">Smartling API</a>.
