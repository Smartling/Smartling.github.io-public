title:  API Sandbox
---
<p>
    The Smartling Sandbox API allows you to test API connection and parameters. The Sandbox API is available to registered API users but does not save or
    return data based on your actual account or project, and the Smartling Dashboard will not reflect data submitted to the sandbox.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        File uploads will cache files without affecting production files and will not extract content for translation.
    </li>
    <li>
        File downloads will always return the referenced files translated completely in "Reversi" (characters of each word returned in reverse order).
    </li>
    <li>
        File statistics services will return mock statistics and metrics for files you've previously uploaded into the sandbox.
    </li>
    <li>
        Even if you specify a callback on the file upload, it will not occur when using the Sandbox API
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>The purpose of the Sandbox API is to test API calls</strong>, so Smartling does not process data from the file. Uploaded files will not appear in the dashboard with their associated strings.
</p>
<p>
    The Sandbox API is accessible at <a href="https://sandbox-api.smartling.com/v1" rel="nofollow">https://sandbox-api.smartling.com/v1</a> and all service
    calls have no affect on production data.
</p>
<p>
    All URLs within the Sandbox API have the following base:
</p>
<p><pre>https://sandbox-api.smartling.com/v1</pre></p>
<p>
    <strong>To get started with the Sandbox API:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Setup an account with Smartling, from: <a href="http://www.smartling.com/signup" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartling.com/signup</a>
    </li>
    <li>
Obtain an API key within your Smartling dashboard:        <a href="https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api" rel="nofollow">https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the Smartling Translation API documentation at: <a href="https://docs.smartling.com/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.smartling.com</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the Sandbox API URL to execute API requests: https://sandbox-api.smartling.com/v1
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Sandbox data may be cleared from time to time, so don't leave anything in the sandbox that you aren't willing to lose.
