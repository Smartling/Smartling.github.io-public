Smartling gives you four options for working with our API depending on your needs:

<div class="api-list">
<div><span>&#10122;</span><h5>SDK</h5>Use our Software Development Kits to integrate Smartling's API into your build process without worrying about low-level details.</div>

<div><span>&#10123;</span><h5>Command Line</h5>Access the API from the command line with our Shell scripts.</div>

<div><span>&#10124;</span><h5>Git or Beanstalk</h5>Set up the Repository Connector to automatically sync Smartling with your Github or Beanstalk repository any time you make a commit.</div>

<div><span>&#10125;</span><h5>REST</h5>Write your own custom API calls to do just about anything you want.</div>
