Smartling gives you four options for working with our API depending on your needs:

* Use our Software Development Kits to integrate Smartling's API into your build process without worrying about low-level details.
* Access the API from the command line with our Shell scripts.
* Set up the Repository Connector to automatically sync Smartling with your Github or Beanstalk repository any time you make a commit.
* Write your own custom API calls to do just about anything you want.
