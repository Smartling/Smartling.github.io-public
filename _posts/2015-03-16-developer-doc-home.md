Welcome to Smartling's Developer Documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to help you integrate Smartling's Translation Management functionality into your development process. For information on the Smartling Dashboard, see our [Help Center](http://support.smartling.com).

### Integrating with Smartling

You can integrate with Smartling using our Translation API. A REST-like API that gives you access to the Smartling Translation Management Platform using defined HTTPS requests and structured JSON responses. Smartling gives you four options for working with our API depending on your needs:

* Use our Software Development Kits to integrate Smartling's API into your build process without worrying about low-level details.
* Access the API from the command line with our Shell scripts.
* Set up the Repository Connector to automatically sync Smartling with your Github or Beanstalk repository any time you make a commit.
* Write your own custom API calls to do just about anything you want.
